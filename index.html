              <p>The Bitcoin Cash community feels there is a need for an initiative to push the economy forward by increasing adoption. The Bitcoin Cash network is made up of a nodes that make up the infrastructure, developers that offer up software upgrade, businesses that make using Bitcoin Cash useful, and users who save and spend Bitcoin Cash. But there is a need for an entity that can drive adoption forward and make sure there are more users and businesses coming into the economy. We propose that this entity is the Bitcoin Cash Fund.</p>

              <p>At the top, you have the funding sources which input funds into the Bitcoin Cash Fund. These are; individual donations, corporate sponsorship, and direct revenue. These funds are all funneled into the Bitcoin Cash Fund. Now, instead of the Fund itself working on projects internally, or handing down projects for the community to work on, the community will be the driving force for projects. The community will be encouraged to self-organise and take ownership of their own projects. The leaders of these projects can then put in proposals for funding  (and any other support they need) to the Fund. The Fund can then allocate funds to projects that have the best cost/impact ratio. Proposals will need to clearly outline the project, with a project plan and a budget.</p>

              <p>Oversight of the fund is by three board members fitting the following criteria.
                <ol>
                  <li>A known and respected member of the Bitcoin Cash community, who is highly active in the community,  willing and able to lead the Bitcoin Cash Fund. This board member would lead the Bitcoin Cash Fund. (member A)</li>
                  <li>A highly active member of the community, and is known and respected. This member would sign off on the decisions/transactions made by member (A) and agrees to support the decisions of member (A) on a voluntary basis, and let member (A) lead the fund unless absolutely necessary. (member B)</li>
                  <li>A very well-known and respected member of the Bitcoin Cash community, who has nothing to gain by acting maliciously, but who probably doesn't have the time to have much input in the governance, due to their other commitments. They would act as a failsafe in-case of security issues. (member C)</li>
                </ol>
                All board positions would last one year (suggested), and would be opened to a vote after the term. The exact details of this voting mechanism will be hashed out in the coming weeks. This governance system is efficient, as I would be able to make leadership decisions effectively, but provides fail-safes to make sure that member (A) does not hold ultimate power over the fund.
